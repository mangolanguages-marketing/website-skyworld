<h3><strong>Communication barriers and family relocation</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Lauren Burke is a corporate library specialist at Astellas Pharma Inc., in charge of gathering and organizing tools
    and resources that support all sectors of the company.</p>

<p>While Astellas is based in Japan, it has large satellite offices in the United States, Germany, and Brazil, where it
    is not uncommon for Astellas employees to travel or relocate. As a result of the communication barriers, it was
    difficult for Astellas employees to collaborate efficiently.</p>

<p>After hearing about Mango Languages from meetings with the Northern Illinois Special Librarians&rsquo; Association,
    and seeing the company&rsquo;s vibrant and energetic presence at multiple leading industry conventions, Lauren
    decided to give Mango Languages a call to see if they could help solve the cultural integration problems she was
    seeing with Astella&rsquo;s reassignment process.</p>

<h3><strong>Mango for Business &mdash; rapid, adaptable language-learning</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Astellas employees are frequently asked to fly to other company hubs to work, but without effective means of
    learning the language and culture of their destination. Fortunately, the Mango Languages app allows employees to
    learn anywhere, at any time, on any device. Users are also able to download lessons, which is ideal for the hectic
    travel schedule of an Astellas employee who may not always have an internet connection.</p>

<p>Though implementing a new resource seemed daunting at first, Lauren was surprised at how seamless it was to integrate
    Mango into Astellas&rsquo; company offerings. She began to hear frequently that the language-training system and
    its culture-learning features were improving employees&rsquo; ability to connect with colleagues across the globe.
</p>

<p>It is not uncommon for family members of Astellas employees to also relocate, now multiplying the need to efficiently
    address communication barriers. Mango&rsquo;s Family Profiles allow each user to add additional profiles, granting
    self-paced language-learning to the whole family and effectively alleviating the difficulties of integrating them
    comfortably into their new and unfamiliar transoceanic home.</p>

<h3><strong>Time-saving features and real-time analytics</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Using Mango makes Lauren&rsquo;s job easier. Previously, Astellas Corporate Library used language-learning software
    that included CDs and DVDs, or involved installation and heavy training. These resources began to add up in training
    supplies and labor hours. It was also difficult to track individual progress and usage as traditional
    language-learning software is not equipped for community usage.</p>

<p>With Mango&rsquo;s cloud-based courses, the only instruction that is required of Lauren is guiding the employee
    through the app download and sign-in process &mdash; if required. From there, the learner can pick up their course
    at their leisure while Lauren monitors progress through Mango&rsquo;s administrative dashboard, the Mango Admin
    Portal (MAP). Progress and usage tracking are imperative for Lauren as it lets her know whether Mango is a worthy
    investment.</p>

<h5>THE SITUATION</h5>

<p>The mission of the Lexington Public Library is to connect people, inspire ideas, and transform lives. For Bobby Webb,
    this mission is achieved by selecting high-quality, high-usage digital resources.</p>

<blockquote>&ldquo;It is vital for a public library to have a robust online presence, especially in a digitally-literate
    community like Lexington ...Digital resources empower our customers to utilize the Library at a time and place that
    best meets their needs.&rdquo;

    Webb is responsible for overseeing digital resources for Fayette County and the greater Central Kentucky area.
</p>

<h5>THE CHALLENGE</h5>

<p>
    Serving the demand of a population of over 300,000 is not easy — or cost-effective — when many language resources lack shelf-life and multi-user access.
</p>
<p>
    Webb’s search for a low-maintenance, highly engaging language-learning resource that delivered a diverse, accessible, and consistently updated language selection needed to check the right boxes.
</p>

<h5>
    THE FIX
</h5>
<p>
    Though other language software vendors have approached Webb and his team, Mango’s cloud-based accessibility, relevant content, and promotional materials have allowed Lexington Public Library to succeed in offering an in-demand language-learning resource to the community.
</p>

<blockquote>
    “Mango ...checks all of the boxes by offering a wide variety of language options (including courses for ESL learners), actively updating the content, and making it available to the entire community at the time and point of need.”

<h3><strong>A global company with a global need</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Michelle Arentz, the Manager of Learning and Engagement for Rust-Oleum, noticed a problem that stretched across all
    company sectors: the globally dispersed department heads and employees couldn&rsquo;t always communicate with each
    other effectively. Errors in translating and inability to communicate with partners in other countries cost the
    company both time and money.</p>

<p><span style="color:#1d98d5;"><strong>SOLUTION</strong></span></p>

<h3><strong>A customizable solution for a diverse company </strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Michelle tried many different language-learning softwares, but couldn&rsquo;t find the seamless, simple solution that
    she needed. After interacting with Mango Languages at the Association for Talent Development trade show, she decided
    to see if Mango&rsquo;s software could help remedy the communication and language barriers experienced by
    Rust-Oleum&rsquo;s frequent travelers and transplanted family units.</p>

<p><span style="color:#1d98d5;"><strong>RESULTS</strong></span></p>

<h3><strong>Positive feedback and trackable results</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Before Mango, one of the biggest struggles Michelle experienced was Rust-Oleum&rsquo;s equal ratio of
    language-learning needs for English speakers learning a foreign language and those needing to learn English. With
    Mango, Michelle is able to provide every employee needing language learning with the proper course while also being
    able to keep track of their progress.</p>

<p>Mango&rsquo;s Family Profiles are hugely beneficial for Rust-Oleum employees that relocate as an entire family unit
    as well. Mango grants individual access to the entire family, which means that Michelle can be confident that any
    employee working abroad, and their family, can confidently interact in their new culture.</p>

<p><span style="color:#1d98d5;"><strong>BONUS</strong></span></p>

<h3><strong>Simplifying work for everyone</strong></h3>
&nbsp;

<p>Mango simplifies Michelle&rsquo;s world by providing her with a product that is easy to use and delivers trackable
    results. Since Mango&rsquo;s cloud-based software requires nothing more than a computer or mobile device, its
    easy-to-use platform reduces the need for IT help and Michelle knows that her Mango customer service representative
    is always available if any assistance is required. Mango also works with other programs that she has available to
    employees, creating a seamless system of language and culture-learning that she is able to customize for
    Rust-Oleum&rsquo;s needs.</p>

<p>In Michelle&rsquo;s words, Mango makes it easy to see and understand how much &ldquo;bang for their buck&rdquo;
    Rust-Oleum is getting with the Mango program.</p>
